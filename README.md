Deep Learning Project 16: Predicting Isoform Expression from Gene-Level Profiles using Representation Learning

The central dogma of molecular biology states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. While a one-gene–one-protein model is often assumed, the process of alternative splicing at the RNA level can result in multiple protein isoforms with distinct biological functions from the same gene. Hence gene expression data only provides a coarse-grained view of transcriptional activity and in many cases disease and cell-type-specific behaviour is determined by which isoforms are expressed. However, while gene expression data is abundant, measuring isoform expression is technically challenging and costly, especially in single-cell experiments. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a computational method for accurately predicting isoform expression from gene expression alone. If successful, this would unlock isoform-level insights for millions of existing RNA-seq samples.
